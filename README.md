# Low-power-RTL-design-using-clock-gating-
The objective of this project is to introduce a smart, two-level power-saving system includes clock gating and frequency scaling for digital circuits called a "unified adaptive clock gating methodology".
# Goals
The main goal is to reduce the power consumption in the circuit.
The primary goal is to create a single, centralized controller that uses for both power saving methods: clock gating and dynamic frequency scaling. This is more efficient than using separate controllers for each functions.
Developing the adaptive system that monitor the circuit activity, whether it is in active mode or in idle mode.				
Project aims to showcase a real-world, standard approach to low power design.
